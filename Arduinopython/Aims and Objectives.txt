Literature Review
AI Gone Mental: Engagement and Ethics in Data-Driven Technology for Mental Health
This article by Sarah Kerr explores the potential of artificial intelligence to transform mental health care. It discusses about the prediction, monitoring, and treatment of mental health problems with the use of AI technologies including machine learning and natural language processing. However, this paper also emphasizes how crucial it is to involve users and take ethical issues into consideration when developing and implementing these technologies. In order to ensure the responsible and beneficial integration of data-driven technology in mental health treatment, it highlights the need to address power imbalances, prejudices, and potential harm that may come from the use of AI and also advocates for transparency, scrutiny, and public trust-building. 
In conclusion, the paper explores how AI can revolutionize mental health treatment while highlighting the importance of ethical frameworks and user participation. It brings up issues with hierarchy, data biases, and possible negative consequences. The paper encourages continuous public involvement, transparency, and supervision in order to ensure that AI is used properly and to build trust in data-driven technologies for mental health.
